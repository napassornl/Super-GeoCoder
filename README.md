# SuperGeoCoder
Super GeoCoder is a web application that allows the user to upload
a file with a table format that stores a list of address to the
browser. The user clicks the Submit button and the browser will
display the table with two new columns of the latitude and
longitude corresponding to the address in each column. Then, the
user will input their email address in the text box that appears
in the browser and click send file. The table will be sent as a .csv
file to the user's email address.
